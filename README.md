# Chanty

## Overview
Chanty is a proof-of-concept micro-framework for building actors in Go. It is inspired by the actor model.

## Why Chanty?
Go is a great language for building concurrent systems. However, it can be difficult to reason about the interactions between goroutines.\
The actor model provides a way to encapsulate state and behavior in a single unit, which can make it easier to reason about concurrent systems.
